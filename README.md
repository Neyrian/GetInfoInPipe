# GetInfoInPipe

## üìå Overview

This malware simulation creates a named pipe and uses it to temporarily store the additional information gathered by creating the following processes: 
- whoami.exe /all
- ipconfig.exe /all
- netstat.exe -aon
  
Each piece of information returned will be encrypted.

A list of running processes on the system will also be gathered and encrypted by calling `CreateToolHelp32Snapshot` and listing processes through `Process32First` and `Process32Next`.
